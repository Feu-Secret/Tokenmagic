# Token Magic FX - Update v0.4.3-alpha

*News :*
- Polymorph effect :
    - Allow image transition between a source image (token, tile, etc.) and a target image of your choice.
    - 9 types of transition are provided :
      - Morphing, waterdrop, waving, twisting, take off/put on your disguise!, tvnoise, hologram, wind and basic alpha transition.
    - Properties to reduce or enlarge the target image.
- XFire effect :
    - A fire filter with advanced properties, designed to be easily colorizable.
    - specific blend modes that do not alter the visual quality of the filter depending on the brightness and intensity of the source image.
    - An advanced mode allows you to choose up to 4 colors to compose your perfect fire.
    - An inlay mode to create new effects, like superfrost or superheat.
    - A chromatic mode.
    - Adjustable scale on the x and y axis.

      - The half of the given oscillation in one loop.
      - A tutorial is provided in the following macro : "36 - T01 - Turn into Mystery Man (polymorph)"

*Updates :*

    - The order in which you put your filters is important.
    - A new property called `rank` allow you to force the ordering of filters on a given target.
      - Filters with lowest rank are executed first, etc.
      - If you do not specify a rank, TMFX will automatically assign rank within its reserved range (10000 to 20000).
      - This system is the default mode and an alternative to the zOrder option, you can use either.
- Transform filter :
    - The twist and bulge/pinch filters have been reengineered and put in the transform filter : 
      - with better performance and the elimination of flicker.
- Updated PIXI libs 

*Deprecated :*

*Fixed Issues :*
- A problem with template effects could arise when changing texture (depending of the texture load time)
- Incorrect interpretation of the "clockwise" animation property by the "Transform" filter
- A problem with the "Fumes" filter, which initialized twice.
- The size of the Force Field filters could be altered by the padding of other filters.
- The force field filters could not be stacked correctly.
- Possibility for the animation loop to attach itself several times to the pixi ticker (which could lead to severe performance problems)

*Need contributors :*
- To translate in several languages. Currently, TMFX supports English and French.
- To create user interface (which can be complex). Because html is my weakness.
- To allow auto-templates on other game systems than DD5.
- Or simply by sending me your macros, presets or others, so that I can share them with the community!
- And thank again to sPOiDar, who was the first to join the project with an awesome contribution.
